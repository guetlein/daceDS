    "description" : "This is a Java based translator that connects the macro and the meso layer of the traffic domain. As this implies the coupling of a continous and a discrete regime, for the direction from macro to meso, meso tuples are sampled by Poisson Arrival Processes based on continous macroscopic flow data."
